Dynamic Alert Mechanism for Detecting Police Cars
This Python script implements a dynamic alert mechanism for detecting police cars via written text and emergency lights using a camera feed. The script continuously captures frames from the camera, processes them for text and emergency light detection, and triggers alerts based on the severity of the detected threat.

Key Features:
Text Detection: Utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) to detect written text related to police cars in the captured frames.
Emergency Light Detection: Implements object detection techniques to identify emergency lights (blue-red light sirens) in the captured frames.
Dynamic Alert Mechanism: Adjusts the intensity or frequency of alerts based on the severity of the detected threat. The severity is determined by the presence of emergency lights and written text related to police cars.
Logging and Analytics: Records detected events, timestamps, and relevant metadata in a log file (alert.log). This logging functionality facilitates analysis and troubleshooting of the system's performance.
Customizable Thresholds: Allows customization of thresholds for different levels of threat severity, enabling flexible alerting based on the detection results.
Dependencies:
OpenCV: Used for accessing and processing the camera feed.
pytesseract: Employed for optical character recognition (OCR) for text detection.
Logging: Utilized for recording detected events, timestamps, and metadata for analysis and troubleshooting.
Usage:
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install opencv-python pytesseract.
Ensure that a camera is connected and accessible by the system.
Run the script, and it will continuously monitor the camera feed, detecting police cars and triggering alerts as necessary.
View the log file (alert.log) for detailed information about detected events and timestamps.
Note:
This script serves as a basic demonstration of dynamic alerting and logging functionality. Further customization and optimization may be required for specific use cases and environments.
